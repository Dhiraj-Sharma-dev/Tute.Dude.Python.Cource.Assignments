# Task 1

# Step one is to take two numbers as input from the user:

number_1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
number_2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))

# Basic mathematical operations from those two numbers:
#Addition
Addition = number_1 + number_2
print("Addition:", Addition)
#Substraction
Subtraction = number_1 - number_2
print("Subtraction:", Subtraction)
#Multiplication
Multiplication = number_1 * number_2
print("Multiplication:", Multiplication)
#Division
Division = number_1 / number_2
print("Division:", Division)
